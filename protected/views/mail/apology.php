<title>Paul Kemp Hairdressing Apology</title>

<html>
<body>
<p>Hi <?php echo ucfirst($model->first_name);?>,</p>

<p>We earlier sent out an e-newsletter that contained an offer. Unfortunately our data got a little mixed up. This offer was intended to entice new clients to the salon only.</p>

<p>We can't apologise enough for this mistake and hope it doesn't cause any inconvenience. We obviously don't want to encourage you away from your existing stylist!</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you in the salon soon.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>The Paul Kemp Hairdressing Team</p>
