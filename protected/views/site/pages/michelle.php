	<h2>Welcoming Michelle Railton to the team</h2>
	<p class="bold"><strong>We're excited to announce experienced stylist Michelle Railton is now a member of our team. Michelle, 25, from Warrington has been hairdressing for over 9 years.</strong></p>
	<p>She previously worked at Daniel Anderson Hairdressing for 3&frac12; years before setting up on her own. After a year she decided self employment wasn't for her and chose to take some time out from hairdressing.</p>
	<p>After a brief time working in the recruitment industry she realised hairdressing was definitely where her heart was.
	When she applied here for the role we snapped her up, as PK stylist <em>Leon Pritchard</em> (who had previously worked with Michelle) had only great things to say about her.</p>
	<p>Michelle is skilled in all aspects of hairdressing including <strong>advanced cutting, colouring &amp; styling, hair ups plus men's hairdressing.</strong>
	She particularly loves soft, natural &amp; luxurious cuts and colours, she's highly skilled in short cuts and loves men's hairdressing too (particularly indie/mod cuts).</p>
	<p>Michelle said <em>"Being part of such a strong team is really exciting, I can't wait to build up a new client base, plus hopefully see some regulars from my salon &amp; Daniel Anderson Hairdressing too!"</em></p>
