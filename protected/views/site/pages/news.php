<h3>Paul Kemp Hairdressing awarded 5 Star salon status</h3>
<p>We're really pleased to announce that we have been awarded a maximum 5 stars by the Good Salon Guide.</p>
<p>The Good Salon Guide is the only independent guide to quality standards in hairdressing and beauty in the UK and Ireland. 
Salons are visited and objectively assessed by professionally trained inspectors against a set of strict criteria (in the same way as the well-known AA or RAC hotel guides), giving consumers confidence in their choice.</p>

<img src="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/images/news_images/tigi-serenity.jpg" width="135" height="120">
<p>There are three journeys to choose from, each catering to specific needs:</p>
<p>1. Resurgence for Dry Hair</p>
<p>2. Serenity for Frizz-Prone Hair</p>
<p>3. Awakening for Weak, Damaged Hair</p>
<p>Each range has a shampoo, a conditioner, and a take home treatment. Plus an intensive in-salon treatment is also available.</p>
<p><em>The range is only available in a select few salons, and Paul Kemp Hairdressing is one of the lucky ones! Since it's arrival it is proving to be a massive hit with the PK team and clients alike.</em></p>
<p>It's a premium haircare range with prices starting at £17.95 for the Shampoos and take-home treatments around the £28 mark. If your hair needs a big pick-me-up then we'd highly recommend the in-salon treatment from just £10.</p>
<p class="offer">The quality of these products can't be under-estimated, the positive feedback from early adopters has been astounding.
If you wan't to give them a try we've got some free sample packs in the salon (only until stocks last!). Drop in to get yours!</p>

Price: &pound;18.50</p>
<h4>The Invati Thickening Conditioner</h4> 
<p>Penetrates the hair shaft with arginine, an amino acid from sugar beets and soy protein. 
It's clinically proven to thicken hair with a blend of guar, palm and grape seed-derived ingredients.<br>
Price: &pound;20.50</p>
<h4>The Invati Scalp Revitalizer</h4> 
<p>A treatment that you spray directly onto your scalp. It's Formulated with turmeric and ginseng and has an ultra delicate formula that will care and soothe your hair and scalp leaving you feeling refreshed and revitalised.
For best results, massage around hair follicles to simulate the scalp to help growth of your hair.<br>
Price: &pound;41.00</p>

<h3>Jack Broady</h3>
<p>Jack is 21 from Stockton Heath. He started out hairdressing when he was just 13 as a Saturday boy and went straight into an apprenticeship from leaving school.</p> 
<p>He has worked in both Stockton Heath and Warrington town centre salons, during this time he went on numerous specialist courses, including a highly respected <em>Vidal Sassoon</em> cutting course. His skill sets cover all aspects of hairdressing. He particularly enjoys cutting, colouring &amp; styling long hair. Jack is also skilled in men's hairdressing.</p>
<p>After taking a short career break, he's eager to get back into hairdressing as it's a big passion of his.</p>
<p>Jack says <em>'I love the hairdressing industry, there's never a dull moment. I'm really glad I've taken the role at Paul Kemp Hairdressing, it's a really strong team and I love the relaxed friendly environment.'</em></p>
<p class="offer">Jack is looking to quickly build up his client base - we're running these incredible offers for a limited time</p>
<p class="offerHeading">&pound;40 Cut &amp; Colour package<br><span style="font-size: .7em;">a saving of up to &pound;30</span></p>

<p>Megan is our latest apprentice to follow in the footsteps of Tash (who has now progressed to Graduate Stylist level).</p>
<p>We're extremely selective with our apprentice choices as we have limited positions available (as little as 1-2 a year). We only select people who demonstrate a raw passion for hairdressing. We could recognise this in Megan straight away when we met her and offered her an apprenticeship.</p>
<p>After having gained some salon experience elsewhere, Megan is eager to push her training to the next level. The goal now is to develop her to the highest standard in a relatively short time.</p>

<p class="offerHeading">Megan is looking for models for blow-dries, plus basic cut and colouring work.</p>
<p class="offer">Call the salon for more details</p>

<p>We are still looking to take on experianced Stylist/Senior Stylists. If you would like to join the team <?php echo CHtml::link('Click Here',array('site/page','view'=>'recruitment')); ?></p>

<h3>One year on: An Interview with Paul Kemp</h3>
<p>It's been an eventful year for Paul Kemp, the launch of his new salon, learning the ropes of running a business and managing a team.</p>
<p>We had the chance to speak to Paul and ask him a few questions about the salon and the future of 'Paul Kemp Hairdressing'.</p>
<p class="reveal">Read More ></p>
</section> <!--end .visible-->
<section class="hidden">
<p class="offer">What have been the highlights of your first year</p>
<p>The first year of business has exceeded all my expectations. I have enjoyed expanding the team; building up our client base and receiving positive feedback from both new and existing client's. Getting a double page spread in Hairdressers Journal <a href="http://www.paulkemphairdressing.com/images/news_images/hj_article.pdf" target="_blank">(read it here)</a> has been a particular highlight.</p>
<p class="offer">What have you found the hardest part of running the salon</p>
<p>Taking on the responsibility of looking after so many staff was a steep learning curve and maintaining the consistently high standards which Paul Kemp Hairdressing is all about.</p>
<p class="offer">How have the team that came from <a href="http://www.jakatasalon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jakata</a> found the change?</p>
<p>At first it was obviously a bit strange however they seem to have adapted very well and love working at Paul Kemp Hairdressing.</p>
<p class="offer">Do you still stay in touch with your old team mates at <a href="http://www.jakatasalon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jakata</a>?</p>
<p>Yes, we have a yearly Jakata/Kemp camping trip and we often meet socially.</p>
<p class="offer">How many members are there on the PK team now?</p>
<p>Eleven, and building fast!</p>
<p class="offer">Tell me about the recent recruits</p>
<p><em>Katie Sergeant</em> joined us from a popular Stockton Heath salon and has now built up a strong client base within a short period of time. <em>Leon Pritchard</em> joined us three months ago from <strong>Daniel Anderson Hairdressing</strong> in Warrington and from the off was very busy. Leon is a very popular young confident stylist.</p>
<p class="offer">Are you taking any more staff on?</p>
<p>We are always looking for new staff, not just stylists but also apprentices who will promote and enhance Paul Kemp Hairdressing.</p>
<p class="offer">How would you describe a typical 'Paul Kemp Hairdressing' Client?</p>
<p>Someone who appreciates the full hairdressing experience plus loves to be pampered and made to look amazing!</p>
<p class="offer">What do you think separates Paul Kemp Hairdressing from the competition?</p>
<p>Our high standards and our fun, friendly and professional atmosphere.</p>
<p class="offer">What made you decide to take the <a href="http://www.aveda.co.uk/" target="_blank">Aveda</a> range on?</p>
<p>I believe <a href="http://www.aveda.co.uk/" target="_blank">Aveda</a> epitomises what Paul Kemp Hairdressing is all about; high end quality products that give superb results.</p>
<p class="offer">How have you found the performance of the products?</p>
<p>Instantly visible results, a perfect addition to our product range.</p>
<p class="offer">Any more new product launches in the pipeline?</p>
<p>Yes! We are the first salon in the North West to be taking on Tigi's exclusive new luxury range <a href"http://www.tigihairreborn.com" target="_blank">'Hair Reborn'</a> which will be arriving in the salon later this month.</p>
<p class="offer">Is the salon performing how you'd like it to?</p>
<p>Definitely, but there is always room for growth and we strive to be even better next year.</p>
<p class="offer">Any plans to open any more?</p>
<p>It's still early days, but I wouldn't rule out opening another Paul Kemp Hairdressing in the not too distant future? ...</p>

<p class="offerHeading">Keep posted for a great prize draw in the coming days!</p>
