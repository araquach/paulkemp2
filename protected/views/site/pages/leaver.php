    <h2>Megan Mullaney no longer at Paul Kemp Hairdressing</h2>
    <p>At the beginning of the month <em>Megan Mullaney</em> decided to move on from Paul Kemp Hairdressing to pursue a new career direction. We were sorry to see her go and wish her all the best in the future.</p>
    <p>If you were a regular client of Megan's we apologise for her departure and we hope it hasn't caused you any inconvenience.</p>
    <p>We're pleased to say that we have other stylists to choose from both here in the salon and at our other salon <strong>JAKATA</strong>, all at a similar level to Megan.  We have the talented <em>Tash Bailey</em> who is slightly more experienced than Meg and <em>Ashley Tennant</em> who is currently a graduate stylist. We also have two stylists at our sister salon <strong>JAKATA</strong> at a similar level to Meg <em>Matthew Lane</em> and <em>Laura Minett</em> so there are plenty of options to choose from. </p>
    <p><em>We would hate to lose you as a customer, we really appreciate your loyalty to the salon and we hope we can continue to look after you for the foreseeable future. We have a fantastic offer as our way of apologising for the inconvenience&hellip;</em></p>
   
    <p class="offer">We'd like to offer you 20% off your next visit</p>
    
    <p>offer applies to Tash &amp; Ashley at PK (01925 444488) and Matt &amp; Laura at JAKATA (01925 242960) for all previous regular clients to Megan. Please mention the offer when booking and to your stylist.</p> <p class="small">(one offer per person, not transferable, ends 31/07/15)</p>
