    <h2>Nathan Hynes no longer at Paul Kemp Hairdressing</h2>
    <p>In early August Nathan Hynes left Paul Kemp Hairdressing. He has taken a break from hairdressing and is currently pursuing another career. We were sorry to see him go.</p>
    <p>If you were a regular client of Nathan's we apologise for this unexpected departure and we hope it hasn't caused you any inconvenience.
    <p>We're pleased to say that we have plenty of other stylists to choose from here in the salon, all at a similar level to Nathan.  We have our latest addition, <em>Jack Broady</em>, plus <em>Leon Pritchard</em> returns back to the salon shortly after his around the world trip. We can also highly recommend <em>Natasha Bailey</em> who has recently been promoted to Graduate Stylist level.
    <p class="offer">We're offering a <strong>free</strong> colour with every Cut, Dry and Style plus a <strong>free £10 </strong>product voucher.</p>
   
    <p>Alternatively, if you just need a Cut, Dry and Style you will receive a <strong>£10 product voucher</strong> as our way to apologise for the inconvenience.</p>
    
    <p>offers apply to Jack, Leon and Tash for all previous regular clients to Nathan. Please mention the offer to your stylist.</p> <p class="small">(one offer per person, not transferable, ends 31/10/12)</p>
