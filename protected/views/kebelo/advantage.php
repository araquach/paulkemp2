	<h3><span class="kebelo_italic">Its a sexy</span><br>SUMMER AHEAD</h3>
	<p>Its goodbye to Brazilian blow-dry treatments and Keratin straightening formulas. 21st century hair is all about having that healthy 'look-at-me' bounce. That's where Kebelo Advantage comes in. The radical smoothing system is bringing sexy back and you with it.</p>
	<p>Hands-up if you have hair that is unruly, frizzy or simply hard to manage? You're not alone. In over 300 women that we surveyed, an astonishing 86% said that was how they would describe their hair. It makes for dismal reading.</p>
	<p>Now hands-up those who look in envy at the few-and-far-between women with silky locks and 'knock-em-dead' colour. Yes - that's us included. There's just something about stunning, shiny hair that is inherently attractive and shouts 'sexiness'. We want!</p>
	<p>But how do you get it? Up to now straighteners and keratin formulas have been the only answer, but they, of course, bring their own problems. It's why we've introduced this unique in-salon service called <strong>Kebelo Advantage</strong>. Once you discover it, your dreams will come true. An amazing smoothing formula, it is aimed at women who care about the health of their hair - and not just the end result.</p>
	<p>Like no other products out there, the in-salon foundation treatment goes to the very root (no pun intended) of the problem. It's innovative carbocysteine technology fills out and strengthens damaged bonds deep inside each hair strand, haling from within and leaving it healthy and strong. It means you are left with smooth, manageable, unbelievable hair and the frizz is gone.</p>
	<p>And the best bit about Advantage? Smooth, silky hair is achieved within just one hour, at an affordable price, and it lasts for an incredible 100 days. Now that's a true advantage we can all lust after.</p>

	<h3>3 advantages of ADVANTAGE</h3>
	<p>Kebelo Spent 18 months creating the first ever long term smoothing system and, in the process, gained a reputation for innovation, safety and creativity. Now they have pioneered a new treatment which has three distinctive benefits not found anywhere else.</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li><strong>TIME:</strong> It only takes one hour to complete. Thanks to the new dispersion technology, the entire application process is quicker and more enjoyable.</li>
	<li><strong>COLOUR:</strong> We can apply colour directly after your Kebelo System Treatment. As it gets to work laying a foundation deep inside the hair, it gives your new colour a vibrancy like never before.</li>
	<li><strong>AFFORDABLE:</strong> You will get shiny, frizz free, easy-to-manage hair from just &pound;99, and that includes over &pound;50 worth of after-care. It amounts to just &pound;1 a day to keep the frizz away!</li>
