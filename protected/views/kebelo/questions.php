	<p>Advice on how to get the best out of your hair and how Kebelo is suited to everyone</p>
	<p>Click on a question to reveal the answer</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>I have not had my hair cut for over a year. It is really long and very damaged. Will Kebelo be able to repair it?</dt>
	<dd>We would suggest first of that we cut your hair. Once the ends are damaged and beginning to break there are only superficial fixes available. Kebelo is all about creating the perfect foundation on which beautiful hair can grow. So once you've had a good trim, then you will definitely from the amazing condition that Kebelo will give to it. You'll notice a huge difference</dd>
	<dt>Who is SILK aimed at?</dt>
	<dd>Everyone can benefit from using SILK and it's very user friendly. Here are some top tips of how to get the very best from the product:<br>
	Shampoo and condition your hair. For optimum results use the Kebelo Revitalising or Enriching aftercare.<br>
	Towel-dry your hair.<br>
	Apply the suggested amount of SILK onto your hair. Work it into the ends and then up towards the scalp and root area. Massage throughout then comb and style.<br>
	Now blow-dry using medium to full heat.<br>
	To really pump the SILK into your hair, use a flat iron, round tong or wand after drying. This will maximise the 3 day smoothing effect. Remember that there is a thermal protector in the product to help avoid damage from heat styling.</dd>
	<dt>How much SILK should I use?</dt>
	<dd>Over time, you will determine how much product to use according to your hair type, but generally:<br>
	If you have fine hair, use 3 pumps.<br>
	Medium hair should use 3 to 4 pumps<br>
	Thick air should use 4 to 5 pumps.</dd>
	<dt>How soon can I shampoo after having a Kebelo treatment?</dt>
	<dd>Your hair will be shampooed in the salon as part of the treatment, so you'll walk out afterwards looking and feeling fabulous. If you feel like swimming the same day as your Kebelo, that's fine too! Your hair will still be beautifully smooth and glossy.</dd>
	<dt>I had my colour done, (an all over tint with some highlights) two weeks ago but I would love to have a Kebelo before I go on holiday in a few weeks time. Is this advisable?</dt>
	<dd>Ideally we would suggest that you have your Kebelo before your colour, but two weeks after would be fine. Remember, Kebelo works from within the hair, underneath colour, so you may even get a few extra lovely tones through your hair.</dd>
	<dt>Why is having a colour better after a Kebelo?</dt>
	<dd>Kebelo evens the porosity of the hair from roots to ends and conditions the hair all the way through. It means that colour holds so much better, and that shine is increased. When hair is dry and brittle, the colour washes out quickly. Having a Kebelo treatment first will add endless benefits to your hair.</dd>
	<dt>I'm going away on holiday and I've always avoided getting my hair wet. But now I've had the Kebelo treatment can I get my hair wet in the sea?</dt>
	<dd>Kebelo works deep inside the hair so salt water will not disturb the treatment as such. However, salt water does dry the hair out so use SILK for extra nourishment and protection. The same rule applies to chlorine in the pool.</dd>
	<dt>I have Afro hair. Can I use Kebelo?</dt>
	<dd>Yes, you can. It's actually a lot better for afro hair than a lot of other straightening systems.</dd>
